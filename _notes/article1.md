Edge computing has emerged as a solution to meet the demands of real-time data processing and communication, but challenges persist in minimizing latency and improving efficiency.

The proposed protocol utilizes adaptive routing techniques and efficient data encoding to streamline communication between nodes. Initial testing highlights a notable reduction in round-trip latency, especially in high-demand scenarios such as video streaming and industrial automation. The design ensures compatibility and industrial automation.

Industries such as healthcare, transportation, and smart cities rely heavily on real-time data. By addressing key bottlenecks, in edge communication, the new protocol provides a pathway to faster and more reliable decentralized systems. The innovation marks a critical step forward in meeting the growing demands of edge computing environments.
