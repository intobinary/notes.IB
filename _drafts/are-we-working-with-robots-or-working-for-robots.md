In the past, machines were tools we controlled -- simple mechanisms that amplified our physical capabilities. But today, the rise of artificial intelligence, along with advanced automation systems, challenges that dynamic. The shift prompts a critical question: '<i>"Do we work with robots or do we work for them?"</i>

<!--
Algorithms can now assign tasks, assess performance, and even decide when someone gets promoted.

* "Is there a subtle shift of power?"
* "Who is truly in control -- the creator, the code, or the context?"

Examing how some workers end up adjusting their pace, behavior, or decisions based on algorithmic commands (eg: delivery drivers following AI-assigned routes).

Discuss how algorithms set goals, manage productivity, and evaluate performance.

Post the question: If the robot (or AI) sets the rules, are we still the ones in charge?

Analyze how working for robots might feel dehumanizing or alienating.

Address concerns around surveillance, micromanagement by algorithms, and lack of autonomy.

Include insights from thinkers like Shoshana Zuboff (surveillance capitalism) or Yval Harari.

Emphasize human oversight, AI ethics, and "human-in-the-loop" systems.

Suggest policies and values that preserve human dignity and agency in workplaces
